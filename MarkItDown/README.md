# MarkItDownSharp


`MarkItDownSharp` is a C# .Net Framework library designed for converting various file formats to Markdown. This makes it suitable for indexing, text analysis, and other applications that benefit from structured text. It is a C# .Net Framework implementation (more or less) of the original `markitdown` [Python library.](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)

It supports:

- [x] PDF
- [x] Word (.docx)
- [x] Excel (.xlsx)
- [ ] Images (EXIF metadata extraction and optional LLM-based description)
- [x] Audio (EXIF metadata extraction only)
- [x] HTML
- [x] Text-based formats (plain text, .csv, .xml, .rss, .atom)
- [x] Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
- [x] Bing Search Result Pages (SERP)
- [x] ZIP files (recursively iterates over contents)
- [x] PowerPoint (.pptx)
- [x] Confluence (spaces and single pages)
